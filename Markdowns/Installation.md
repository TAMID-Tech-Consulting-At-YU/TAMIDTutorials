# Node.js Installation Guide

A simple abbreviated guide for downloading [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) and [NPM (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/). 

# Windows

### Downloading

Begin by downloading the [Node.js LTS (Long-Term Support)](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the windows installer prompts.

### Confirming

Once you have Node.js downloaded, confirm that Node and NPM are installed correctly by running the following commands in a terminal.

Running
```
node -v
```
Should return the version number like this: 
```
v14.18.1
```

Running 
```
npm -v
```
Should return the version number like this: 
```
6.14.15
```

# MacOS

### Downloading
Begin by downloading the [MacOS Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and run the ```.pkg``` installer. Then accept the license, select the destination, and authenticate the install.
