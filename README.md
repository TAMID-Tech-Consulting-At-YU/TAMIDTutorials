# TAMID Node.js Repo
The purpose of this repository will make sure everyone is comfortable using the basics of Node.js. In addition to that, it should give everyone experience with using Git in a team environment, which is beneficial for any future jobs or internships. Please share any tips, tricks, tutorials, or anything helpful with each other no question is a stupid question! Collaborating is important! I'm excited about a semester working together!

# Git

"Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency." 

The [Git Guide](Markdowns/Git.md) will help you set up git and learn some basic commands. After finishing, please make a repository for your tutorial, then send that repo to the group chat so others can see/share ideas and progress. If you choose not to send your repo to the group chat, please send it to me, which will allow me to debug and help with any issues that may arise.  

# Software Installation

"Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser."

This [Installation Guide](Markdowns/Installation.md) will help get Node and NPM installed in your repo.
